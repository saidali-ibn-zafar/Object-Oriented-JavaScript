# freeze() method?

The .freeze() method in JavaScript is used to freeze an object, which means that once an object is frozen, its properties cannot be added, removed, or modified. This is a way to ensure that the object remains immutable, providing a level of data integrity and preventing accidental changes to its properties.

 
```js
class Settings {
  constructor() {
    this.settingsObject = {
      background: "ff0000",
      version: Math.floor(Math.random() * 4000),
    };

    Object.freeze(this.settingsObject);
  }

  get(key) {
    return this.settingsObject[key];
  }
}

```

`Object.freeze(this.settingsObject)` is used to freeze the settingsObject property of the Settings class instance. By doing so, it ensures that the settingsObject cannot be modified after it has been initialized in the constructor.
